## About

This project is my first real application, tailored to a company. Ths main idea of the app is to manage the entire workflow of a department in the company, in order to improve control, information access and management. 

---

## Features

- [x] Technical and comercial parts of the department can connect to each other, by sending:
   - [x] costumer and product information
   - [x] real time service status
   - [x] warranty control

---

## How it works

This project is divided into two parts:
1. Backend (server folder)
2. Frontend (web folder)

Both Frontend and Mobile need the Backend to be running to work. This Github project contains only the Frontend, as the Backend part can be found <a href="https://github.com/realian00/veder-project-server">here</a>
